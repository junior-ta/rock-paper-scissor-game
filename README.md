# rock-paper-scissor-game
Practicing python by creating a rock-paper-scissor game

Rationale: Designing a rock paper scissor game as complex as I can, putting into practice my pyhton skills

process:
    #creating a list of possible choices for the players
    #saving the players name
    #initializing both players' scores
    #creating variables to monitor the number of rounds played(r) and the number of iterations(i) 
    #iterating my while loop until i=0
        #game design I guess? (^_^)
        #prompting the user to pick an option and making sure a bad input doesn't break the game
        #using a method from the random module to generate a random opponent 
        #designing the game algorithm (making sure a tie adds an additional round)
    #Displaying the winner, YAY!!
